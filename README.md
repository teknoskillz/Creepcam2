# Creepcam2
Creepcam Version II for Darkplaces

Basicly a modified version of Creepcam Version 1, except includes Darkplaces QC extensions file to make full use of Darkplaces optimizations
if the modder chooses to.

This mod is coop designed only and includes "Ogres fire grenades into cover" mod, and the chasecam now has a respawn timer where it will find 
another player so they can be chased while another player respawns. If no players are available, monsters are cammed, or if killed by a monster,
that monster is camerad till respawn

Also added ident code for looking at a player to see their netname, Oxygen/ Biosuit level meter for player and cameras chasing them,
QIP's Armor drowning fix, QIP's Ax walkframe bugfix.

The base src of this mod is Gnouc's clean QC src which has "killstring" fixes for the obit messages that display wrong ones if the player
changes weapons quickly.

Future plans include scoring frags based on types of monsters killed, and partial frags for when players team up to kill a monster.
